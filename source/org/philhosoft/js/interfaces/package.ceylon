"Dynamic interface definitions for JavaScript objects."
// Note that most interfaces here are really only interfaces in the Dom model:
// they don't have constructors, so we cannot create them with new.
// In general, we have to call something like document.createElement() or similar, or to get them out of the Dom / HTML.
