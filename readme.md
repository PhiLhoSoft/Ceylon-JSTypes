# Ceylon JS Types

Types for JavaScript and for the Dom.

Defining `dynamic` interfaces from the Web IDL, to interact with JavaScript in a typed way, without spreading `dynamic` everywhere in the code, behaving like JS is strongly typed... :-)

I thought of using the TypeScript definitions (from Microsoft and from the [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped) site) but it was more work than it was worth to be useful, and it was a bit incomplete. I might use DefinitelyTyped for libraries, though.

So I went to the [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) site instead, and from there and from the official documents they link to, I gathered the type inormation along with short descriptions that I used (ater editing for conciseness and consistency) as class / method documentation.
